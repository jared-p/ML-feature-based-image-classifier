# ML-feature-based-classifier

This project involves training a machine learning algorithm to differentiate between three unique Lego brick shapes that vary by colour, orientation, and location within the image. The final algorithm can accept new images, and sort the object in the image into one of the three categories.

The classifier uses an sophisticated edge detection algorithm to generate features to clasify images.

Code is well commented in the analysis directory.
